# There are mainly two factors are there to anaylze algorithms:
## Time Compleixty 
## Space Complexity

## Time complexity depends upon the multiple factors like Processor(Single Core, multicore), Machine Architecture (32 bit, 64 bit), Execution (Sequencial, Parallel), Memory Access Time (read, write).

## These are machine dependent factors.
## But the time complexity is decided based on the input given to the Algorithm.
